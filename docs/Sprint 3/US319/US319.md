## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As Ship Chief Electrical Engineer I want to know the thermal resistance, for each operating temperature, of each container that must contain at least three different materials in its walls.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications


From the client clarifications:


### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria


* AC1:"For each container, working at a temperature of 7ºC, determine the thermal resistance it offers, according to the choice of materials made."
* AC2:"For each container working at a temperature of -5ºC, determine the thermal resistance it offers according to the choice of materials."

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies


* There is a dependency to "US317 - As Ship Chief Electrical Engineer I want to know what set of materials to use in a container, to operate at temperatures of 7°C." and "US318 - As Ship Chief Electrical Engineer I want to know what set of materials to use in a container, to operate at temperatures of -5 °C." since the materials of the containers are defined in these User Stories.
