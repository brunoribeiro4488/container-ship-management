**Test 1:**
		
	@Test
	void getgenerators() throws IOException {
	EnergyWithSidesController energyWithSidesController = new EnergyWithSidesController();
	String result = energyWithSidesController.getgenerators(10,2,20,10,12,20,20);
	String expected = "To maintain the temperature of 10 containers of -5ºC and 10 containers of 7ºC arranged in a specific way, 1 generators of 75KW are needed";
	Assertions.assertEquals(expected,result);
	}
