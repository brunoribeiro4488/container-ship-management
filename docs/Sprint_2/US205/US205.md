# US 205 - As Ship Captain, I want the list of containers to be offloaded in the next port, including container identifier, type, position, and load.

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As Ship Captain, I want the list of containers to be offloaded in the next port, including container identifier, type, position, and load.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications


From the client clarifications:

* Question: "Dear customer, to perform this functionality do you want the "next port" to be an "input data" or do you want some other way to find the "next port"?"
	* [Answer:](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=12314) "In my opinion, the next port is the next one on the route, where movements (cargo loading and unloading) might occur."
* Question: "For the sake of this project, should we assume that the same person can be ship captain of multiple ships over time, and that  a ship can have multiple ship captains over time, or no?"
	* [Answer:](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=12208) "Yes, assuming that a ship captain cannot be at two ships at once."
* Question: "According to the literature provided, Cargo Manifest is going to have a dynamical behavior, i e,  each time a Ship/Truck arrives at a Warehouse/Port it will deliver to the Staff a Cargo Manifest and, after the process of offloading and loading, the Staff will deliver to the Captain/Driver the new Cargo Manifest. Is this reading correct? If not could you clarify?"
	* [Answer:](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=12166) No. Partial cargo manifests are delivered to the team at the port and partial manifests are given to the ship's captain.
