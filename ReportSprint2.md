## Team Performance

In the first week of sprint , we were a bit slow because we didn't have the necessary knowledge to carry out the tasks so we took the opportunity to analyze the Us and organize ourselves

In the second week , We took a deeper look at some Us and were implementing the Us that we had analyzed earlier.

In the third week as we had the project analyzed, we just had to implement the remaining user stories.

Overall, it can be said that all elements of the group worked to reach our goal.
